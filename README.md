# 🔎 GPT Researcher

**GPT Researcher is an autonomous agent designed for comprehensive web and local research on any given task.** 

The agent produces detailed, factual, and unbiased research reports with citations. GPT Researcher provides a full suite of customization options to create tailor made and domain specific research agents.
**Our mission is to empower individuals and organizations with accurate, unbiased, and factual information through AI.**

## Why GPT Researcher?

- Objective conclusions for manual research can take weeks, requiring vast resources and time.
- LLMs trained on outdated information can hallucinate, becoming irrelevant for current research tasks.
- Current LLMs have token limitations, insufficient for generating long research reports.
- Limited web sources in existing services lead to misinformation and shallow results.
- Selective web sources can introduce bias into research tasks.

## Architecture

The core idea is to utilize 'planner' and 'execution' agents. The planner generates research questions, while the execution agents gather relevant information. The publisher then aggregates all findings into a comprehensive report.

</div>

Steps:
* Create a task-specific agent based on a research query.
* Generate questions that collectively form an objective opinion on the task.
* Use a crawler agent for gathering information for each question.
* Summarize and source-track each resource.
* Filter and aggregate summaries into a final research report.


## Features

- 📝 Generate detailed research reports using web and local documents.
- 🖼️ Smart image scraping and filtering for reports.
- 📜 Generate detailed reports exceeding 2,000 words.
- 🌐 Aggregate over 20 sources for objective conclusions.
- 🖥️ Frontend available in lightweight (HTML/CSS/JS) and production-ready (NextJS + Tailwind) versions.
- 🔍 JavaScript-enabled web scraping.
- 📂 Maintains memory and context throughout research.
- 📄 Export reports to PDF, Word, and other formats.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### Installation

1. Install Python 3.11 or later. [Guide](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python/install-python).
2. Clone the project and navigate to the directory:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/assafelovic/gpt-researcher.git
    cd gpt-researcher
    ```

3. Set up API keys by exporting them or storing them in a `.env` file.

    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY={Your OpenAI API Key here}
    export TAVILY_API_KEY={Your Tavily API Key here}
    ```

4. Install dependencies and start the server:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python -m uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```

Visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to start.

For other setups (e.g., Poetry or virtual environments), check the [Getting Started page](https://docs.gptr.dev/docs/gpt-researcher/getting-started/getting-started).

## Run as PIP package
```bash
pip install gpt-researcher

```
### Example Usage:
```python
...
from gpt_researcher import GPTResearcher

query = "why is Nvidia stock going up?"
researcher = GPTResearcher(query=query, report_type="research_report")
# Conduct research on the given query
research_result = await researcher.conduct_research()
# Write the report
report = await researcher.write_report()
...
```

**For more examples and configurations, please refer to the [PIP documentation](https://docs.gptr.dev/docs/gpt-researcher/gptr/pip-package) page.**


## Run with Docker

> **Step 1** - [Install Docker](https://docs.gptr.dev/docs/gpt-researcher/getting-started/getting-started-with-docker)

> **Step 2** - Clone the '.env.example' file, add your API Keys to the cloned file and save the file as '.env'

> **Step 3** - Within the docker-compose file comment out services that you don't want to run with Docker.

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

If that doesn't work, try running it without the dash:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```


> **Step 4** - By default, if you haven't uncommented anything in your docker-compose file, this flow will start 2 processes:
 - the Python server running on localhost:8000<br>
 - the React app running on localhost:3000<br>

Visit localhost:3000 on any browser and enjoy researching!



## 📄 Research on Local Documents

You can instruct the GPT Researcher to run research tasks based on your local documents. Currently supported file formats are: PDF, plain text, CSV, Excel, Markdown, PowerPoint, and Word documents.

Step 1: Add the env variable `DOC_PATH` pointing to the folder where your documents are located.

```bash
export DOC_PATH="./my-docs"
```

Step 2: 
 - If you're running the frontend app on localhost:8000, simply select "My Documents" from the "Report Source" Dropdown Options.
 - If you're running GPT Researcher with the [PIP package](https://docs.tavily.com/docs/gpt-researcher/pip-package), pass the `report_source` argument as "local" when you instantiate the `GPTResearcher` class [code sample here](https://docs.gptr.dev/docs/gpt-researcher/context/tailored-research).


## 👪 Multi-Agent Assistant
As AI evolves from prompt engineering and RAG to multi-agent systems, we're excited to introduce our new multi-agent assistant built with [LangGraph](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/langgraph/).

By using LangGraph, the research process can be significantly improved in depth and quality by leveraging multiple agents with specialized skills. Inspired by the recent [STORM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14207) paper, this project showcases how a team of AI agents can work together to conduct research on a given topic, from planning to publication.

An average run generates a 5-6 page research report in multiple formats such as PDF, Docx and Markdown.

Check it out [here](https://github.com/assafelovic/gpt-researcher/tree/master/multi_agents) or head over to our [documentation](https://docs.gptr.dev/docs/gpt-researcher/multi_agents/langgraph) for more information.

## 🖥️ Frontend Applications

GPT-Researcher now features an enhanced frontend to improve the user experience and streamline the research process. The frontend offers:

- An intuitive interface for inputting research queries
- Real-time progress tracking of research tasks
- Interactive display of research findings
- Customizable settings for tailored research experiences

Two deployment options are available:
1. A lightweight static frontend served by FastAPI
2. A feature-rich NextJS application for advanced functionality

For detailed setup instructions and more information about the frontend features, please visit our [documentation page](https://docs.gptr.dev/docs/gpt-researcher/frontend/frontend).
